# DAPs, convenience or luxury

## General idea

Simply put, music makes our surroundings prettier. Those subjective harmonic arrays of sound can change one's point of view and perspective in an instant, implicitly making its wide availability one of the most important modern conveniences, psychologically speaking.

With that in mind, I've always adored the idea of portable media players. Having music available locally whenever you want, not being dependent on third party services which may or may not disappear off the face of the earth. I also personally can't get over the fact that convenience is not taken to the extremes as is with smartphones, it just does its own thing and it's quite simple.

Thus I've meticulously researched about the modern use of MP3 players and saw that they're unfortunately not commercially viable anymore. I was almost at my wits' end, until I saw that DAPs (Digital Audio Players) do indeed exist. I searched for prices and immediately hit the wall due to a magical thing called import tax. Suddenly, the idea was put on hiatus as I was not ready to throw large amounts of money at a small hobby nor did I want to mess around with used IPods and Rockbox (maybe someday!).

## Finding the perfect device

So there I was at a standstill and months passed. My 6 year old phone was at its last legs in terms of battery life and I did not care enough to fix it immediately (big mistake), but I digress.

I wanted to listen to music and still have my phone last throughout the day, so I once again began searching for cheap DAPs on an online local marketplace for used goods. We shall not comment on how I prioritised things. :)

A faint glimmer of hope emerged amidst the chaos of spam posts and lousy Walkmans. FiiO M7, a Chinese DAP that needed fixing and setting up which made the price self-explanatory but seemed good enough according to audiophile circles, appeared out of nowhere. Was it worth it to cross the Rubicon?

## Making the most out of it

With restored/updated firmware, it all works great. It's Android Nougat based and I didn't like FiiO's default player so I replaced it with Poweramp which behaves a lot better. The M7 does not have Wi-Fi enabled even tough it technically can, but can install Android Packages easily with no problems.

Some albums are a whole other experience as I've already had a small library of high-resolution audio to try out. Honestly, some tracks don't have enough of a difference but those that do are incredible to listen to. I'm currently running Sony AKG earbuds which work adequately for my standards, but can be switched out for better IEMs ([In-Ear Monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-ear_monitor)) which will probably be my next upgrade in the long run.

# Every codec has its container

## Modesty with storage media

Believe me, I love my [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)s, but the one and only disadvantage is that they take up so much storage. My cheap SD card cannot handle those demands.

That's where [OPUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_(audio_format)) comes in. Here's some [nifty graphs](https://opus-codec.org/comparison) showing how OPUS solves all of my problems. Let's talk data compression. OPUS handles it great. Bitrate of 128kb/s is enough for our audio to sound transparent when converting from FLAC (at least to me, everyone's auditory perception is wildly different).

For example, a regular FLAC file can go from 20 or 30MB to 100MB depending on the length of the song we're looking at, while OPUS lowers that number to around 5MB. If you're willing to sacrifice bitrate, that number can go even lower. I've seen three minute songs take up around 2MB with 96kb/s. In comparison, some of my first CD rips with Vorbis take up around 10MB.

## Conversion to OPUS and tagging troubles

It's only good to convert from lossless to lossy. This is a [good article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_loss) why it's good to avoid lossy to lossy transcoding. I've written a small bash script which uses [FFmpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg) so that I can easily convert my FLACs to OPUS when needed. Unfortunately, FFmpeg does not have proper OPUS support regarding tags, so I usually use [Kid3](https://kid3.kde.org/) to add album art properly. Here's a link to [that specific FFmpeg issue](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/4448) regarding album art if someone's interested.

This is the script I've mentioned if anybody wants to reuse it:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]
then
	echo -e "\e[31mParameter expected.\e[0m"
	exit 1
fi

if [ "${1##*.}" != "flac" ]
then
	echo -e "\e[31mFlac file expected.\e[0m"
	exit 1
fi
	
SONG="$(basename "$1" .flac)"

# flac into ogg
ffmpeg -i "$1" -vn -acodec libopus -b:a 128k "$SONG.ogg"

exit 0
```

# Some kind of conclusion?

If anything, it's incredible how much money people are willing to spend for perfectly reproduced audio. I get that there's a difference when it comes to the listening experience, but that difference isn't worth that kind of money from where I'm standing as a casual.

## TL;DR

A cheap DAP, transparent-like OPUS files and a budget pair of reviewed earbuds is the way for a **new hobbyist**. Maybe a couple of original FLACs here and there for tracks you're really into which have a point for being kept in high quality.

For people who **do not care** about DAPs and sound-quality, I still recommend using OPUS as it's far superior than something like MP3 which is currently 32 years old. Yes, hardware support is not as good as for MP3 but it's overall worth it due to better compression.



## Regarding tags

Please tag your [rips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripping). If you're too lazy, make it work with [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org). Don't leave your files disorganised if you want to have a good local library.
